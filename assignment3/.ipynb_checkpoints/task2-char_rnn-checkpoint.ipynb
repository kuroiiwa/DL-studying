    "Char-RNN implements multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models. In other words the model takes one text file as input and trains a Recurrent Neural Network that learns to predict the next character in a sequence. The RNN can then be used to generate text character by character that will look like the original training data. This network is first posted by Andrej Karpathy, you can find out about his original code on https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn, the original code is written in *lua*."

    "From above two concepts, we here clarify the meaning of batch_size in RNN. Here, we define the number of sequences in a batch as N and the length of each sequence as M, so batch_size in RNN **still** represent the number of sequences in a batch but the data size of a batch is actually an array of size **[N, M]**."
